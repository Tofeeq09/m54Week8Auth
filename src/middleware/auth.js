// Importing External Dependencies
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt"); // Import the bcrypt library, which provides cryptographic functions for password hashing. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, specifically to protect against multi-GPU password cracking attacks.

// Importing Internal Dependencies
const User = require("../users/model"); // Import the User model from the users module, which defines the structure of user data in the database. This model represents the users table in the database and provides methods for querying this table.

// Environment Variables
const saltRounds = parseInt(process.env.SALT_ROUNDS); // Get the number of salt rounds from environment variables and convert it to an integer. Salt rounds determine the complexity of the hash, affecting the time it takes to generate. The higher the number, the more secure the hash, but also the more time it takes to generate.

// Middleware Functions
// Hash the password middleware for the POST /signup route
const hashPassword = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { password } = req.body; // Extract the password from the request body using object destructuring. This is the password that the user has entered in the signup form.
    if (password && req.passwordChanged !== false) {
      // The condition if (password && (req.passwordChanged !== false)) checks two things:
      // 1. password: This checks if a password is provided in the request body. If req.body.password is undefined, null, an empty string, or any other falsy value, this part of the condition will be false and the password won't be hashed.
      // 2. req.passwordChanged !== false: This checks if req.passwordChanged is not false. This part of the condition will be true in two cases:
      // A. In the signup route, where req.passwordChanged is undefined because the checkPasswordChanged middleware is not used.
      // B. In the update route, where req.passwordChanged is true because the checkPasswordChanged middleware has determined that the password has changed.

      // So, the password will be hashed in the following cases:
      // In the signup route, if a password is provided.
      // In the update route, if a password is provided and it has changed.

      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds); // Hash the password using the bcrypt.hash() function. This function takes the password and the number of salt rounds as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to the hashed password. The saltRounds variable is used to determine the complexity of the hash, affecting the time it takes to generate. The higher the number, the more secure the hash, but also the more time it takes to generate.
      req.body.password = hashedPassword; // Replace the plaintext password in the request body with the hashed password. This is how we securely store the password in the database.

The function bcrypt.compare() takes the plaintext password and the hashed password as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the passwords match. This is how we verify the user's password.
