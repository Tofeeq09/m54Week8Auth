// Importing External Dependencies
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt"); // Import the bcrypt library, which provides cryptographic functions for password hashing. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, specifically to protect against multi-GPU password cracking attacks.
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken"); // Import the jsonwebtoken library, which provides functions for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

// Importing Internal Dependencies
const User = require("../users/model"); // Import the User model from the users module, which defines the structure of user data in the database. This model represents the users table in the database and provides methods for querying this table.

// Environment Variables
const saltRounds = parseInt(process.env.SALT_ROUNDS); // Get the number of salt rounds from environment variables and convert it to an integer. Salt rounds determine the complexity of the hash, affecting the time it takes to generate. The higher the number, the more secure the hash, but also the more time it takes to generate.

// Middleware Functions
// Hash the password middleware for the POST /signup route

      // The condition if (password && (req.passwordChanged !== false)) checks two things:
      // 1. password: This checks if a password is provided in the request body. If req.body.password is undefined, null, an empty string, or any other falsy value, this part of the condition will be false and the password won't be hashed.
      // 2. req.passwordChanged !== false: This checks if req.passwordChanged is not false. This part of the condition will be true in two cases:
      // A. In the signup route, where req.passwordChanged is undefined because the checkPasswordChanged middleware is not used.
      // B. In the update route, where req.passwordChanged is true because the checkPasswordChanged middleware has determined that the password has changed.

      // So, the password will be hashed in the following cases:
      // In the signup route, if a password is provided.
      // In the update route, if a password is provided and it has changed.

      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds); // Hash the password using the bcrypt.hash() function. This function takes the password and the number of salt rounds as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to the hashed password. The saltRounds variable is used to determine the complexity of the hash, affecting the time it takes to generate. The higher the number, the more secure the hash, but also the more time it takes to generate.
