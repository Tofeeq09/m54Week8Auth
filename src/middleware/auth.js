// Importing External Dependencies
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt"); // Import the bcrypt library, which provides cryptographic functions for password hashing. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, specifically to protect against multi-GPU password cracking attacks.

// Importing Internal Dependencies
const User = require("../users/model"); // Import the User model from the users module, which defines the structure of user data in the database. This model represents the users table in the database and provides methods for querying this table.

// Environment Variables
const saltRounds = parseInt(process.env.SALT_ROUNDS); // Get the number of salt rounds from environment variables and convert it to an integer. Salt rounds determine the complexity of the hash, affecting the time it takes to generate. The higher the number, the more secure the hash, but also the more time it takes to generate.

// Middleware Functions
// Hash the password middleware for the POST /signup route
const hashPassword = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { password } = req.body; // Extract the password (a string data type) from the request body (an object data type) using object destructuring. This is the password that the user has entered in the signup form.
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds); // Hash the password using bcrypt. The function bcrypt.hash() takes the plaintext password and the salt rounds as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to the hashed password. The hashing process involves generating a salt using the specified salt rounds and then hashing the password with this salt.
    req.body.password = hashedPassword; // Replace the plaintext password in the request body with the hashed password. This ensures that only the hashed password is stored in the database, not the plaintext password. This is important for security reasons, as storing plaintext passwords can lead to serious security breaches if the database is compromised.

    next(); // Call the next middleware function or the route handler in the stack. This could be another middleware function that performs additional processing, or it could be the route handler that responds to the request.
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: { name: error.name, message: error.message, stack: error.stack } }); // If an error occurs, send a 500 Internal Server Error status code and the error message in the response. This could be due to a problem with the bcrypt library, a problem with the request body, or a problem with the server itself.
  }
};
// Compare the password middleware for the POST /login route
const comparePassword = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { username, password } = req.body; // Extract the username and password (both string data types) from the request body (an object data type) using object destructuring. These are the credentials that the user has entered in the login form.
    const user = await User.findOne({ where: { username } }); // Find the user by username. The function User.findOne() takes an object with a where property that specifies the condition to match. It returns a promise that resolves to the first user that matches the condition or null if no user matches. This is how we retrieve the user's data from the database.
    if (!user) {
      res.status(404).json({ message: "User not found" }); // If no user is found, send a 404 Not Found status code and a message in the response. This means that there is no user in the database with the entered username.
      return; // Return early to prevent the next() function from being called. This stops the middleware chain and prevents the route handler from being called.
    }

    const match = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password); // Compare the plaintext password with the hashed password stored in the user object. The function bcrypt.compare() takes the plaintext password and the hashed password as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the passwords match. This is how we verify the user's password.
    if (!match) {
      res.status(401).json({ message: "Password is incorrect" }); // If the passwords don't match, send a 401 Unauthorized status code and a message in the response. This means that the entered password does not match the password in the database for the entered username.

    //   updatedAt: user.updatedAt,
    // }; // If the passwords match, attach the user's username to the request object. This is a placeholder for the actual login logic, which would involve generating a session or token. This is how we authenticate the user and start a new session.

    // const { password: userPassword, ...userWithoutPassword } = user.toJSON(); // In this code, const { password: userPassword, ...userWithoutPassword } = user.toJSON(); destructures the user object into userPassword and userWithoutPassword. The ... syntax is the rest operator, which collects the remaining properties (i.e., all properties other than password) into a new object userWithoutPassword.
    // 1. user.toJSON(): This is a method provided by Sequelize (a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server). It converts the instance of the user model into a plain JavaScript object, which is easier to work with.
    // 2. const { password: userPassword, ...userWithoutPassword } = ...: This is JavaScript destructuring assignment syntax. It's a way of extracting multiple properties from an object or array in a single statement.
    // 3. password: userPassword: This extracts the password property from the object returned by user.toJSON() and assigns it to a new variable named userPassword. The colon (:) in this context is used to rename the variable to which the value is assigned.
    // 4. ...userWithoutPassword: The ... is the rest operator. It's used to gather the remaining properties (not already extracted via destructuring) into a new object. In this case, it gathers all properties of the user object except for password into a new object userWithoutPassword.
    // req.userData = userWithoutPassword; // If the passwords match, attach the user's data to the request object. This is a placeholder for the actual login logic, which would involve generating a session or token. This is how we authenticate the user and start a new session.
